== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a countdown timer? =

Navigate to **Appearance > Customize > Elevate Alerts > Count Down**. Enable the countdown feature, set your target date and time in the format provided. The countdown will automatically calculate and display the time remaining.

= Can I customize the appearance completely? =

Absolutely! Elevate Alerts provides comprehensive customization options including typography, colors, spacing, dimensions, and layout controls. Everything is accessible through the WordPress Customizer with live preview.

= Is the plugin mobile-responsive? =

Yes, Elevate Alerts is fully responsive and optimized for all device sizes. The alerts automatically adjust their layout and styling for optimal viewing on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

= Can users dismiss the alerts? =

Yes, users can collapse/dismiss alerts by clicking the close button. The plugin remembers their preference using browser cookies, so the alert won't reappear for that user session.

= Can I use HTML in the alert content? =

Yes, the content editor supports HTML and allows formatting. However, all content is properly sanitized for security using WordPress's `wp_kses_post()` function.

= Does it work with caching plugins? =

Yes, Elevate Alerts is compatible with popular caching plugins. The countdown functionality uses JavaScript for client-side updates, ensuring accurate timing regardless of caching.

= Can I target specific pages? =

Currently, alerts appear site-wide. Future versions may include page targeting functionality. You can control visibility through the customizer's show/hide options.

= Is translation support available? =

Yes, the plugin is fully translation-ready with proper text domain implementation. All user-facing strings can be translated using standard WordPress translation methods.
